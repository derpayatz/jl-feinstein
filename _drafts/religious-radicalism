My biggest critiques for religiously Jewish radicals. You can't keep trying to catch the religion up; it's not just about your personal spirituality. Declaring personal ownership of spiritual practice is maybe OK for Protestants, but our religion the religion has always belonged to the community; this is how we've survived as a people. If you want to move the religion you have to do it with the rest of the community; you can't move so far ahead that the people in the front and the people in the back completely lose sight of each other. It's just as bad when radical Reforms and Reconstructionsits do it by adding too much too fast, and rejecting too much, as when the Ultra-Orthodox do it by refusing to see anything or anyone whos's different from themselves. 

Judaism has oppressive practices that date back thousands of years, to its very beginnings and our politics are too urgent to wait for them to catch up, even as we may have confidence that they eventually will.

The religion is too oppressive for me so I don't participate in it; but I am considerably more comfortable with Conservative ritual than with Reform ritual. That's because the Reform ritual, especially the radical Reform ritual, is too hard for me to recognize as something that is within the horizon of communal consensus.
