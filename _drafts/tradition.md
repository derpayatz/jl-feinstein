The Jewish religion isn't and has never been a buffet, an inspiration mine, or anyone's personal plaything to do with as they please. Even as an ardent Atheist I am very upset at the "do whatever you want" attitudes, and disrespect shown by some American Jews (who claim to be so passionate) to Judaism. It feels just like cultural appropriation: assimilated White Jews ripping stuff out of context and without consideration to "make it their own."

Even those Jews who take the trouble to actually learn about the stuff that they're abusing (and those are a minority in my experience) don't seem to care that they are treating an entire tradition and a coherent whole (what is a coherent whole?) that meant everything to generations of ancestors, as their personal property to do whatever with and use for "inspiration," "it's meaningful to me," or w/e.

Casual, unthinking blasphemy and treating your heritage as your personal property is not respect for your ancestors or connection with them (deliberate and pointed blasphemy is, of course, we're Jews after all).

And yes, you can appropriate your own stuff if you're that assimilated into Whiteness. Your genetic lineage doesn't give you special rights.

I've tried so hard to organize spaces where people don't have to practice Judaism to be Jewish, and ended up getting pushed out myself because I don't practice

**What is change?**

Core vs. external signifiers

I don't think that people are allowed to engage with culture on their own terms, if those terms include treating it as personal property. What does this mean? 

"do you rlly think that no Jewish religious traditions are the outdone of individual syncretism, done outside the structures of the dialogue you’ve described, passed along and caught on?" Minhag vs Halakha

Personal reasons, shmersonal reasons, but also intent

"Coherent whole"—wtf is that, never happened
however, integrative: as we innovate, we should be referencing and being in dialogue with as much of the existing body as we can

I think that in Rabbinical Judaism it is traditional to make high educational demands of people who want to innovate, and it's a tradition

"often it was the child without formal education who was looked down on by many in the community that had the most to teach...
You can absolutely have critical thought and engagement without requiring obscene amounts of education and study...
And to say that creating and modifying tradition must be something held in the exclusive grasp of those with that education is classist, elitist, ableist bull and I cannot object more highly to that"

when I say coherent whole what I mean is that the bits are all in relationship to one another, not that they never contradict or pull in different direction. Then again, even that kind of coherence was only ever an aspiration. But it was that, I think

There is nothing wrong about being assimilated. Some of the best Jews I know, as well as myself, are assimilated af. I'm talking about harmful behaviors that are rooted in assimilation

Spinoza was talking to Jewry, we wouldn't listen
