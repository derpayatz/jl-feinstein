Makhnovtchina is a song celebrating and mourning the Free Territory[0], a peasant insurrection in the Ukraine during the Russian Civil War led by Nestor Makhno (1888-1934), a poor Ukrainian shepherd, farmhand, and foundry worker[1]. This insurrection is still remembered by many in the Former Soviet Union as a moment of freedom and people power between the Tsar's yoke and the oppressive regime of the Bolsheviks. It is a true story, messy and painful and full of the defiant and courageous spirit of regular people standing up for each other in solidarity against overwhelming forces of violence and oppression.

The song was probably written originally in French by songwriter Ã‰tienne Roda-Gil (1941-2004) in the 1960s[2][3]. The song was translated into Russian, Ukranian, and Esperanto in the early 2000's [2]. Some believe that there existed an earlier text in Ukrainian dating back to the Civil war, which would have been translated into the French, but no evidence exists for this hypothesis[2] although after the betrayal and defeat of the Black Army by the Red Army in 1921[4] Makhno along with other Russian and Ukranian Anarchists fled to France[1].

The melodic theme of Makhnovtchina is from an older song, "From the Taiga" by Vladimir Gilyarovskiy, which was composed no later than 1915[5]. Two other famous songs were written to this melody: the Far Eastern Partisans' anthem "Over Valleys and Mountains" by Peter Parfenov and the Tsarist "March of the Drozdovists.[6]" Notably, the Drozdovists took part in the decisive defeat of the Tsarist forces by Makhno's Black Army at Orel[7], and is the subject of one of the verses of Makhnovtchina.
