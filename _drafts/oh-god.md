Oy God, what is this world?
What is this world you made our God?
We toil every day that you gave and for what?

To watch our fathers hold their pain in anger
To watch our mothers lose their minds to care
To watch our lonely children cry from hunger
And all of this for you in silence bear

And all the while, the sun you made,
He rises and he sets, and so again
A new day dawns upon this lion's den.

Oy God Oy God Oy God…

Please stop the sun a little for your Yidn
We're always going everywhere you're leading
But it's so hard when, by Your Name,
The world just stays the same…
Do what you did for Joshua again.

Our Father in the Sky
Who made us creatures in Their image
You weep like we do, our Heavenly Mother?

Your wayward, headstrong children that you made
To us you are a jealous, vengful God;
How many times have we for mercy prayed?
You do not spoil us, you do not spare the rod.

Oy God Oy God Oy God…

Please stop the sun a little for your Yidn
Nail it up just like you did in Gibeon
Then maybe for a day or two
We'll have some peace from you;
And then go back to suffering anew…
