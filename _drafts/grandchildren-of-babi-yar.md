I could have been your second cousin,
on a visit for a summer, when
we were both fifteen.<!--more-->

Remember how we people-watched commuters at the bus stop,
while the world went by, as we held hands
and blushed together…

Or when we stole candy from the corner store—
that red-faced bourgeois
caught us, but we were too fast.

Remember how one week my grandpa came,
thick and heavy like his glasses, he smelled
of pipe tobacco and eau-de-cologne.

He taught us about galaxies, and light
diffraction, and he told us stories
of Einstein's violin.

Never forget that summer, stolen
chocolate and kisses, under a hot sun…

Remember me! Though I was never born,
and Grandpa never lived to shave
and use eau-de-cologne.
