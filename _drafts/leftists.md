One of my favorite things to think about is words and their meanings. A recent Facebook post by a friend has precipitated the thought that for the word "Leftist," which we all use as though it means something, I can think of three different meanings right off the top of my head.

1. Liberal egalitarian politics
2. Tribal belonging to USSR-derived political "tendencies"
3. Class - based politics
