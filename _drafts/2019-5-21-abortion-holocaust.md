I've been reading lately that people are out there comparing abortions to the Holocaust—until recently I've been blissfully ignorant of this rhetoric—and it's kind of hard to describe how it makes me feel because it's hard to write words and sentences when feeling like that.<!--more-->

Christians out here are bringing up the Holocaust—one of theirs, if you'll forgive the honesty—to shill for legislation that bans *mainstream* Jewish practice. I may personally be an atheist, but I do think that it's relevant that Judaism *requires* Jews to perform abortions under certain circumstances; that is, when the life and well-being of the mother[^1] is in danger. 

What constitutes enough harm to tip the scales, there's debate about that, this being Judaism. In the case of life-threatening pregnancies, however there is a consensus that an abortion is absolutely required.

Anyway, back to the Holocaust. This isn't just about white people. This is about *Christians,* and more than that, *conservative* Christians, All-Time, All-Star Murder Champions of the World; and not just the murder of Jews, not by a long shot.

 Those people should shut the f up and put a sock in it, especially one of mine from back when I felt that hygiene lacked integrity and was unmanly, and consequently contracted staph on my feet.
