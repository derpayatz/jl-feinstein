<section class="verse" markdown="1">
Stones, strewn beneath the sun on a quiet hill;

The wind rustles among the grass.

Reverend bones turned to dust and dirt,

Artifacts of pottery and bronze waiting to be classed and counted,

Should that be their fateâ€”

Else lie and fade and be forgotten,

Revert to clay and tin and copper ore.

<section class="verse" markdown="1">
The ghost in an inscription cries in a forgotten tongue: behold my works!

And is carried by the wind

Far beyond the count of centuries and years.

</section>

<section class="verse" markdown="1">
Seasons chase and pass anon,

Caring not for bleaching stone.

</section>

<section class="verse" markdown="1">
While bees make love to flowers and lizards bask,

There is always an alternative
