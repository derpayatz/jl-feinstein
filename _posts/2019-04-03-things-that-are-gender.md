title: The Things That Are Gender

For most of the last 15 years, my gender has been like one of those toys at amusement parks, two bars of steel with a current through them that you grasp while they shock you. <!--more-->It's supposed to be a challenge to see how much pain you can endure, as the current rises. However, the current also causes your muscles to contract, so letting go isn't easy: you have to consciously override the involuntary contraction. It's a very macho game. Of course, unlike real life, those games are calibrated so that the current can't really harm you...

I think that gender can also be a mystery, or a puzzle. I would like to learn how to reconcile my gendered self-perceptions both with my body and with my emotional tendencies and needs, and I don't know how to do that yet. I don't want to be at war with my body, but sometimes I feel like I am; like I need to somehow defeat it in order to become. But that seems like a paradox. My body is part of who I am and my becoming, not an obstacle; the process of becoming is getting the pieces to fit together.

I would like to believe that gender can also be a gift, or a beautiful thing. I've had glimpses of it, whenever for a moment things felt _just right._ I think that gender can be a work of art, an intricate whole. The opposite of grotesque, self-hate, denial, and pain. I hope to be able to take a step back some day and see that.
