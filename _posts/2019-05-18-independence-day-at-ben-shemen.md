So when I was growing up in Israel, I have a lot of interesting memories from those days. We used to go with the family to this forest near Jerusalem on Independence Day, to celebrate and grill shishliks and kebabs and relax among the trees. It was never my favorite thing to do—I'm not much of an outdoor type—so I don't really have a lot of memories from it. But I do remember the stones. <!--more-->

There weren't very many, but the park's grills were made of big limestone slabs half-buried in the ground, and thick iron bars to put the food on. There were also rough benches made of limestone. I don't know why they made an impression on me; limestone is a very common building material in Israel.

So, fast forward ten or fifteen years. I was now living in the United States. I had left that poisonous swamp of an ethnostate with few regrets, but I guess I hadn't quite put it behind me. I was fairly active in Palestine solidarity, and I was still learning new things about the place I had grown up in and escaped, things that were maybe hinted at but not really covered in school.

In history class we learned a lot of facts about the Jewish National Fund. We learned how it was an institution set up to buy land for Jewish settlement during the Ottoman and British Mandate periods. We learned that it still managed a lot of land, and of course we also knew that it had planted those pine-tree forests all over the country, including the same one where I had eaten kebabs on Independence Day as a child.

What we didn't learn was what had been on the site of those forests.

You see, like most JNF forests, Ben Shemen, where we celebrated Independence Day, was planted on the former site of 5 Palestinian villages: Jimzu, Dayr Abu Salama, Khirbat Zakariyya, Haditha, and Khirbat al-Duhayriyya. Those villages had been depopulated in 1948 by Zionist militias, as part of an organized campaign of ethnic cleansing during Israel's War of Independence.

No wonder those slabs were there.

I suppose it makes sense: we were, after all, celebrating the establishment of the State of Israel, something that could not have been done without the destruction of the place in whose ruins we were having a family feast.
