Remember, second-cousin
the summer when I came to visit,
when we were both fifteen?<!--more-->

We used to people-watch commuters at the bus stop,
while the world went by, as we held hands
and blushed together…

Or when we stole candy from the corner store—
that red-faced bourgeois
caught us, but we were too fast.

Remember how one week my grandpa came,
thick and heavy like his glasses, he smelled
of pipe tobacco and eau-de-cologne.

He taught us about galaxies, and light
diffraction, and he told us stories
of Einstein's violin.

Never forget that summer, stolen
chocolate and kisses, under a hot sun…

Remember me! Though I was never born,
and Grandpa never lived to shave
and smoke and use eau-de-cologne.
