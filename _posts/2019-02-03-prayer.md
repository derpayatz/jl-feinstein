{% verse %}
Oy God, what is this world?
What is this world you made our God?
We toil every day that you gave and for what?<!--more-->

To watch our fathers hold their pain in anger,
To watch our mothers lose their minds to care,
To watch our lonely children cry from hunger,
And all of this for you in silence bear…

And all the while, this sun that you created
He rises and he sets above this earth,
To rise again and see us still as weighted
With Your world's futile cares and futile mirth.

Oy God Oy God Oy God…

Please stop the sun a little for your Yidn
We're always going everywhere you're leading
But it's so hard when, by Your Name,
The world just stays the same…
Do what you did for Joshua again.

Our Father in the Sky
Who made us creatures in Their image
Do you weep like our mothers when we cry?

Your wayward, headstrong children that you made
To us you are a jealous, vengful God;
How many times have we for mercy prayed?
You do not spoil us, you do not spare the rod.

Oy God Oy God Oy God…

Please stop the sun a little for your Yidn
Nail it up just like you did in Gibeon
Then maybe for a day or two
We'll have some peace from You;
And then go back to suffering anew…
