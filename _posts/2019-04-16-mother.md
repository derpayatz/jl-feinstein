Mother,

What would you think
if you could see me now?<!--more-->

Mother,

I don't remember telling, but
I'd always wanted to be you.

Your frame was so tall and beautiful,
your eyes, so dark and lustrous.

Your mind was so subtle and perceptive,
your pride, so haughty and perilous.

Mother,

You strode like a giantess
through a world too small to contain you.

You laughed like a girl
under a sunny sky, while joys were too rare.

You loved like a goddess,
and raged like a queenâ€¦

Mother,

What would you think 
if you could see me now?

Mother,

I always wanted to be you
when I grew up;
now I am growing up,
and you are gone.
