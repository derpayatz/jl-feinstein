On my way to school today
the car was covered—
and I mean *really* covered—
in birdshit.<!--more-->

I may have been impaierd,
even impressed,
but I was certainly not surprised, because
last night I saw the crows
perched on the trees behind my house,
hundreds,
like some kind of Hitchcock movie.

We startled each other repeatedly
as I stumbled out the back door
with my wine and my cigarettes
all through the night

glass after glass,
smoke after smoke,
each time a little more slurred
and hoarse, but not tired,

a little more
relaxed
happy
not lonely…

Each time I missed her a little less,
her who is gone, who can't be replaced
except by wine and cigarettes

(and writing,
writing reminds me
that not all beauty is gone
from my life,
there is still beauty
