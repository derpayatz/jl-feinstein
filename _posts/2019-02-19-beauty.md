On my way to school today
the car was covered—
and I mean **really** covered—
in birdshit.<!--more-->

Last night I saw the crows
they perched on the trees behind my house,
hundreds,
like some kind of movie.

We startled each other repeatedly
I stumbled out the back door
they crowed and they flew
away from me 
with my wine and my cigarettes
all through the night

glass after glass,
smoke after smoke,
each time a little more slurred
and hoarse, but not tired,

a little more
relaxed
happy
not lonely…

Each time I missed her a little less,
who is gone, who can't be replaced
except by wine and cigarettes

(and writing,
writing reminds me
that not all beauty is gone
from my life,
there is still beauty
