{% verse %}
Such a bitter alchemist is loss,
transmuting golden joy to leaden poison;
how subtly it ingrains its deadly dose!

into my lungs, crushing,
into my limbs, weakening,
into my eyes, dimming,
into my throat, choking,
into my tongue, parching,
into my heart, muffling.

I have no breath to endure,
I have no strength to hold on,
I have no sight to be dazzled,
I have no voice to sing,
I have no taste to enjoy,
I have no heartbeat to live.

I dread the coming of another day
and labor silently alone in darkness;
beneath this sun there is no other way.
