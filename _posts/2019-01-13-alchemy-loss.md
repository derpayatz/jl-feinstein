<section class="verse" markdown="1">
Such a bitter alchemist is loss,

transmuting golden joy to leaden poison;

how subtly it ingrains its deadly dose!

<section class="verse" markdown="1">
into my lungs, crushing,

into my limbs, weakening,

into my eyes, dimming,

into my throat, choking,

into my tongue, parching,

into my heart, muffling.
</section><!--more-->

<section class="verse" markdown="1">
I have no breath to endure,

I have no strength to hold on,

I have no sight to be dazzled,

I have no voice to sing,

I have no taste to enjoy,

I have no heartbeat to live.
</section><!--more-->

<section class="verse" markdown="1">
I dread the coming of another day

and labor silently alone in darkness;

beneath this sun there is no other way.
