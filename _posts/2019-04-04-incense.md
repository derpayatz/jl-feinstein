{% verse %}
The small red embers of the incense burned
like an incandescent flame of rage;
All the rage, however many embers:
decorated rooms that weren't mine,
with their scented candles, and their damn
bouqets in vases or in pickle jars...<!--more-->

The small red embers of the incense choked
my throat with smoke and burned my heart.
The candles and the flowers (that weren't mine)
would twist my mouth in a contemptous sneer;
sweet scents and perfumes made me gasp and cough,
and made my eyes weep irritated tears.

And now in my own decorated room,
a stick of incense burns with sweet perfume.
